## SSBU Calculator
Web based Smash Ultimate knockback calculator

### How to use it
Just input your data, the calculator will update the results when you change something

Move data from Ultimate Hitboxes doesn't contain autocancel windows, additional shieldstun multipliers nor additional hitstun frames

#### Launch Visualizer
*Note: Stage layout collision detection might give weird results and bounced trajectories are not accurate, character models/ECBs/animations not included so KO percents are not accurate* 

Visualize launch trajectory, position per hitstun frame and distance launched in a graph and display stage layout with collision detection

* Each marker represents each frame in hitstun
* Line color represents vertical momentum
* Cyan markers represents frames that hitstun can be cancelled by using an airdodge
* Magenta markers represents frames that hitstun can be cancelled by using an aerial
* Move angle can be inverted horizontally to visualize hitting opponents from the right side
* Add stage layout with platforms and blast zones with physics (Collision, traction along surfaces, bounce off a surface angle calculation)

## Tools

### KO calculator
https://rubendal.github.io/SSBU-Calculator/kocalc.html

Calculates opponent's KO percentages on inputted position on a stage, it can also calculate best DI angle the opponent can use to survive on that position or generate a vector field to get best di possible on various positions however this calculation is a heavy process so it could freeze the page for a moment or even get a popup that the page isn't responding

Reminder: character models/ECBs/animations not included so KO percents are not accurate by a small margin

### Percentage Calculator
https://rubendal.github.io/SSBU-Calculator/percentcalc.html

Get target percent required to obtain certain knockback, on FKB moves calculate the minimum rage to reach specified knockback
